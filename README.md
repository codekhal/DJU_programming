# My aim of making this repository

This repository is based on class of DJU lecture.

I'll write down what I learned and do some assignment.

I just wanna be a good programmer and good artist.

This is the first step to my dream.

Whosoever is interested can come and put his assignments,issues and solution to those of mine.

If you find any grammatical fault in my sentence please correct me!
