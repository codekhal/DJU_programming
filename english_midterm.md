Every year companies spend millions of dollars on advertising to create buzz about their products - in other words, to get people talking about them. Companies know that people like to talk about unsual, funny, and remarkable things, Nowadays, companies are using many creative ways to help products become more popular.

One idea that can contribute to popularity is to do something very unusual. RedBull is a company that makes energy drinks. They want people to feel energetic when thy think about Red Bull. So they sponsored an unusual event: 43-year-old Felix Baumgartner jumped from 39 kilometers up in space to set a new world record for skydiving. He traveled more than 1,300 kilometers per hour in a space suit with Red Bull's name on it. This is part of a new trend in advertising, in which companies pay for unusual events, hoping that customers will talk more about their products.

Some other companies choose to do something surprising so that people will remember their product and spread their idea. A good example is a company called Blendtec. Tom Dickson, Blendtec's owner, had an idea to make his blenders look more interesting. He made videos showing his blenders mixing up unusual things. He put items like smartphones, rakes, or sports equipment into one of the machines and asked, "Will it blend?" People were surprised to see a blender cut a smartphone int small pieces. Everyone talked about the videos and wanted to find out more about the blenders. Dickson was invited to demonstrate his products on TV shows. His blenders became much more popular, and he sold a lot more of them.

The compnay that makes Doritos a snack food, had a different idea about creating buzz. They decided to get their customers involved. So they bgan a competition. They asked customers to make their own TV ads. The, they asked viewers to choose the ads that they liekd th best. This created buzz because people like to participate and express their own opinions. 

Another way to make a product popular is to connect it in people's minds with something that they see often. To improve saled, the maker of Kit Kat chocolate bars used advertisements that connected Kit Kat bars witeh coffee. They hoped that every time people drank coffee, they would think of Kit Kat bars. They werer right. Sales improved by more than 50 percent when people connected Kit Kat bars with coffee.

There are many ways that advertisers hope to make their products become popular: doing something surprising or exciting, asking customers to get involved, or connecting the product with something that people see regularly. Whatever method is uesd, the result is clear: more buzz and more popularity.

Colors affect everyone
Each person may have a different answer to these questions, but we can agree that colors affect everyone. We think carefully about color when we choose our clothes or select paint for a room. But we are often unaware of how color affects us. For example, the color of a room may affect our emotions. Advertisers use color to influence our choices at the supermarket. In addition, we may not realize that colors have many different meanings.

Universal meaning
Colors in nature have universal meaning. For example, trees and plants are gree, so the color green often represents life and nature. Blue, the color of the sky, oceans, and lakes, makes us think of air, water, and peace. Colors in the red spectrum - yellow, orange, and red - are warm colors. Those colors may give us a feeling of warmth and comfort or feelings of anger. Colors in the blue spectrum - colors such as blue, green, and purple - are cool colors. They often give a feeling fo calmness or sadness. These ideas about color are similar around the world.

Colors in health
Humans have know about the power of color for a long time. Ancient cultures in China, Egypt, and India used colors to heal sicknesses. People believed that each color had a healing power. For example, people used blue to decrease pain. Even today, some people say that colors can help people feel better. However, research shows that although colors may chnage the way a person feels, they cannot heal an illness.

Cultural meaning
Colors also have differetn meanings in different cultures. A color may represent good feelings in one culture but had feelings in another. For example, in the United States white represents goodness. It is usually the color of a bride's wedding dress. However, in India, China, and Japan white can mean death. Green is the color of dollar bills in th U.S., so green may make Americans think of money But in China, green can represent a loss of respect. Different colors sometimes represent the same idea in different cultures. In European cultures, purple is the color of royalty for kings and queens. In Aisa. yellow is the color of royalty. In addition one color will have many different meanings within one cultures.

Color psychology
Color psychology is the study of how colors affect our emotions. Researchers are finding that colors can change our behavior in specific ways. For example, one research study showed that people could lift heavy weights more easily in blue rooms. Other studies have looked at how colors influence decisions. Soccer referees gave competitors in blue clothing higher scores than competitors in red. In another study, students who saw the color red before a test did much more poorly. Of course, these test results might vary from culture to culture.

Most people do not realize how much color affects them. It can affect how people think, feel, and act. Some colors, such as those in nature, can havae the same meaning for everyone. Other colors' meanings may be different in different cultures. We can increase our understanding of ourselves and the world around us by learning about wha tcolors can mean or represent.

<04> What makes a competition unfair?
Money and Sports

"Goal!" shouts the announcer. It is a familiar sound for Real Madrid these days. They have just scored another goal against a visiting team. Compared to Madrid, the other side looks weak. The visiting players know that it is almost impossible to win a game aginst such a strong team. Real Madrid has better players, better coaches, better equipment, and better salaries. They have something that many teams that are not as wealthy.

Real Madrid is now the richest soccer team in the world, with England's Manchester United the second richest. Madrid is worth more than $3.3 billion. Manchester United is worth more than $3.1 billion and Barcelona is worth $2.6 billion. These clubs have enough money to pay the high salaries of the best players in the world. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo used to play for Manchester United. Now he is Madrid's top player and erans $21.9 million per year. The richest clubs can py the highest salaries of the best players. Other wealthy clubs include Arsenal, Bayern Munich, and AC Milan. As a result, these clubs have been very succesful. For example, Real Madrid has won nine European Cup championships, more than any other team. Between 2003 and 2013, all but two of the European Cup champions were from the 10 wealthiest teams. Money is a clear advantage for these soccer teams.

The wealthiest teams make money in several ways. First, they can sel tickets at high prices because fans want to see the top players in action. Second, television stations pay the teams to broadcast their games. Third, large companies give financial support to the best teams. These corporate sponsors pay money so that their company name can be on the clubs' shirts, shoes, and stadiums

The recent success of the English team Chelsea shows an example of the effect of money on a team. For many years. Chelsea was a club with little money and few winds. Tehy didn't have a lot moeny to pay good players. Their last championship win was in 1955. Everything changed in 2003 when Russian billionarie Roman Abramovich bought the team for $233 million. In his first year, Abramovich spent more than $350 million on players. By 2006, Chelsea had won two championships. Now Chelsea is one of the richest clubs in the world. 

Many sports fans feel that money in sports creates an unfair advantage. Soem teams have so much money that it seems impossible for poorer clubs to beat them. Wealthy teams are usually more successful. It is difficult for them to get money form tickets, television, and corporate sponsors. Sports fans know that money gives some clubs a great advantage.

There are no easy solutions to this problem, but there are some possibilities. Some people think that rich teams could share some of their money with the poorer ones. This way, the poorer teams would be able to pay higher salareis for better players. Another solution is to put a limit on teh amount of money that teams can spend on players' salaries. This way, the players' salaries. This way, the players' salaries would not continue to rise so much. However, finding and agreeing upon the best solution si very complicated.
Sports fans love close competitions between athletes, but everyone wants teams to compete fairly. Fair competitions do not seem possible when there are a small number of teams that are very wealthy. Money creates unfair advantages in professional sprots, and although there are no easy answers, we should continue to search for ways to make sports fair.
